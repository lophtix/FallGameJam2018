# LiU Fall Game Jam 2018

## Repeat the Feat

Puzzle game with a time traveling alchemist who travels back in time to solve puzzles.
* Push buttons & switch levers to open doors (walk using arrows or WASD-keys) 
* Need to push many buttons at once? Jump back in time to the start (press left control button).
* Work together with your (ghostlike) future self(s) 
* Rewind in time (press shift button) to undo (not longer than last time travel)

Made at the LiU Fall Game Jam 2018 during 48 hours, the 16:th-18:th november 2018, at Creactive, Mjärdevi Science Park, Linköping, Sweden. This game is based on the Game Jam theme "metal time-traveling".
